    "An interesting example of a library combining multiple time series models is `darts` https://unit8co.github.io/darts/ . It takes a slightly different approach then AutoTS: instead of automatically combining a set of models from a predefined list, it allows us to setup evaluation of different models in standardized manner.\n",

    "In this section we will focus on a very useful feature of darts: backtesting. A frequent approach to validation of time series models is to split the data on time: training set are all the observations up to some time point ùë°0\n",
    "\n",
    "and validation is the part afterwards. While simple to set up, this approach runs the risk of overfitting to our chosen validation set. The historical_forecast method built into all the models in darts solves this problem by allowing us to perform a walk-forward validation:\n",
